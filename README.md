# Data-Science
This is a record of my data science learning notebooks.
1. This notebook is a solution for stellar classification, including data cleaning, Feature Selection, Model Interpretability and AutoML. Used stellar classification as database. [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17) 
2. A tutorial for SVM. This notebook introduced everything I think important about SVM
3. A small practice on Neural Network for type classification
